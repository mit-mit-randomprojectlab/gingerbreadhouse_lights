# gingerbreadhouse_lights

Sound-activated lightshow for Circuit Playground Express board (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/overview)

Creates a rainbow lightshow that fades in and out using on-board neopixels when triggered by digital microphone reading on the
Circuit Playground (easy way to activate is to blow on the board).

Was used as part of a gingerbread house display, but could be used for any purpose.
